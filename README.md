# The Royal Game of Ur
The Royal Game of Ur is one of the oldest known board games. I was introduced to it by this video which does a good job
at explaining the game while also being entertaining: (https://youtu.be/WZskjLq040I).

I thought the game seemed pretty interesting, so I thought it would be a fun project to program it. I programmed a graphical interface
to play the game through, and desinged a simple AI to play against. 

I used the following sound files in my game:
